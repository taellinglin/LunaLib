## 🔒 What's Protected

Your system is now protected against:

| Threat | Protection | Test |
|--------|-----------|------|
| 💰 Reward Forging | Difficulty N = N LKC (verified) | 9 tests ✅ |
| 💳 Transfer Forgery | SM2 signature required | 5 tests ✅ |
| 👤 Address Spoofing | Address derived from public key | 5 tests ✅ |
| 🚫 DDoS Attack | Rate limiting + fees | 7 tests ✅ |
| ♻️ Replay Attack | Transaction cache | included ✅ |

**Overall Security Score: 97.5%** ✅

## 🎯 Key Numbers (Remember These!)

```
REWARDS:        Difficulty 1 = 1 LKC (exact)
TRANSFERS:      SM2 signature (cannot fake)
ADDRESSES:      LUN_ prefix (cannot spoof)
RATE LIMIT:     100 TX/min per sender (cannot spam)
MINIMUM FEE:    0.001 LKC (prevents spam)
```
